# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Sabina Lenskaya in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative

expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-
phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text

and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.
Project Description
In this Project I will examine the Health Care stocks universe that trade on NASDAQ to identify the relevant pairs that would be best used for the market-neutral (beta-hedged) Pairs Trading strategy. The goal of this code is to scarp the data and slice the universe of the stocks based on the availability and quality of daily trading data. Then, statistical analysis or correlations will be used to systematically find the best pair of stocks that exhibit the necessary attributes.
Based on the results of this exercise it would be possible to compare the returns on this strategy to the returns on the other possible portfolios that include the selected stocks. This way, the profitability of this trade over the sample period of time will be assessed.
